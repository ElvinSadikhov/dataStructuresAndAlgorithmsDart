//! Challenge 3: A Tree Traversal Interface
// Since there are many variants of binary trees, it makes sense to group shared functionality in an interface. The traversal methods are a good candidate for this.
// Create a TraversableBinaryNode abstract class that provides a default implementation of the traversal methods so that conforming types get these methods for free. Have AvlNode extend this.
